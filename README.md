# Research-Harvesting_signals
In this journal I'll reseach powerless wifi devices and types of energy and frequencies harvesting in public spaces. 
This is a different kind of git, totally out of my confort zone and much more in the realm of physics. 

### Educational goals: 
- know more about wifi antennas
- know more about signals, frequency, and waves
- natural frequency analysis of objects
- experimenting with sound waves
- wifi hichicking 
- materials propieties

### Idea
Improving laptop battery efficiency.
